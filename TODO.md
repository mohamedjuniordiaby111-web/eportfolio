# TODO: Fix Certification Images and Improve Design

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update the href paths in the certifications section to point to the new 'image/' folder (e.g., 'image/Cisco_Packet_Tracer.pdf.pdf')
- [x] Replace the simple <ul> list with a styled grid layout using cards for better visual presentation
- [x] Add CSS styles for the certification grid to match the eportfolio's neon theme
- [x] Test the updated links to ensure PDFs open correctly
